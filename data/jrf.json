    "description": "Kalaeloa Airport, formerly Naval Air Station Barbers Point, was originally developed as a WWII naval air field. With base closures in the late 1990's it was realigned as a joint-use civililian/military airfield. Although predominantly home to the Coast Guard, Kalaeloa is also a bustling general aviation and air service relief field for Honolulu. It gets its code from the name *J*ohn *R*odgers *F*ield, named after John Rodgers, naval veteran and aviation pioneer.",
